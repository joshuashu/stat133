# Please use the family.csv dataset to answer the following questions. Write
# your code so that it works for an arbitrary dataset of the same format as
# family.csv 

# load in the data and save it as a data frame called family.
# family <- your code here


# Use the summary function to examine the dataset.
# your code here


# How many family members are there in the dataset?
# n.family <- your code here


# How many males? How many females?
# n.males <- your code here
# n.females <- your code here


# What are the female names? The male names?
# f.names <- your code here
# m.names <- your code here


# What is the average age of individuals whose age is recorded?
# avg.age <- your code here


# What is the average age of individuals who are not named Tom, Ann, or Joe?
# avg.age.subset <- your code here

# Create the vector fratio that gives the height to weight ratio for each family
# member. Add this vector to the data frame <family>
# fratio <- your code here
# family <- your code here


# How many individuals are taller than the average height of the family? How
# many are shorter?
# n.tall <- your code here
# n.short <- your code here


# How many individuals are more than 1 sd above the average height?
# n.really.tall <- your code here
